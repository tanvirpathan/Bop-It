# Bop-It
An iOS project to recreate an old party game with a modern touch.

The game is simple - the user must react to a command by performing various gestures within a given time period. 
The commands include:
  - Flick It! (swipe down green stick)
  - Spin It! (swipe in any direction to make the gear spin)
  - Stretch It! (stretch the yellow goo)
  - Pull It! (pan the orange knob)
  - Bop-It! (hit the centre of the board)

As the score gets higher, the allowed reaction time period becomes shorter and only the best can truly become legendary!
