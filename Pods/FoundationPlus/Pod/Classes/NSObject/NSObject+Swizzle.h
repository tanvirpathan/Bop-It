@interface NSObject (Swizzle)

// Discussion: Switches the implementation of two methods. To call the originalSelector, instead call localSelector and vice-versa. Only use this method to swizzle local methods. If you swizzle a method from a superclass with a method from a subclass, whenever you call the method on the superclass, you will receive a 'NSInvalidArgumentException', as the superclass will not have the implementation added; instead, use swizzleSelector:withSuperclassSelector
// Call this to swap two methods on the same class level (not for subclasses)

// Discussion: Switches the implementation of two methods, adding the selector to the superclass. To call the originalSelector, instead call localSelector and vice-versa. This will not override superclass behaviour.
// Call this to swap methods, regardless of class level difference
